 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.intro:1 "The fire crackles, casting long shadows on the wall of the servant’s quarters. A wizened old woman holds children agog with her tales.\n\n"
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.basque.a:1 ""...the Aatxe is a cave spirit who is most often seen in the beastly form of a red bull, protecting people from baleful influences and attacking thieves.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.basque.b:1 ""...the Gaueko is a night-spirit. He refuses to allow humans to work outside after dusk, and any displays of nocturnal bravado — such as boasting of not fearing the dark — will draw his ire.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.galician.a:1 ""...the Ojáncanu are bloodthirsty, hairy giants with twice as many teeth as a [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]. Their critical weakness is one singular white hair that — if pulled — kills them instantly.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.galician.b:1 ""...the Estadea are the wandering dead who haunt villages at midnight. Shambling along, they follow an entranced living soul who is compelled by to lead them until daybreak. If that person does not manage to pass on his ghostly parade to another unfortunate being, they wither and die within weeks.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.castilian.a:1 ""...the Devil's Horses appear when people make bonfires to purify their souls. With manes as black as night, damselfly wings, and mouths foaming, they appear from the ashes with an explosion. Each one is the soul of a sinner with its own tale to tell.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.castilian.b:1 ""...the Ventolines are air spirits who aid sailors. Angelic in appearance, with eyes the color of sea-foam and wings that look like crashing waves, they live in the carmine clouds of sunset. If a good sailor finds themselves becalmed, the Ventolines will blow wind into the sails to get them back to shore.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.catalan.a:1 ""...the Cocollona is a river monster. It was originally a faithless nun who was punished for her sins and imprisoned. Her jailers only allowed her outside to visit the Onyar river. Eventually, she sprouted scales, and she now prowls underneath bridges awaiting unsuspecting prey.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.catalan.b:1 ""...the famous Dip is the hound of hell and the Devil's diplomat. A blood-drinking murderer, the wolf-like creature roams the fields at night slaughtering cows and unfortunate humans. Lame in one leg, his glowing red eyes are the last thing many drunkards staggering home see.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.aragonese.a:1 ""...the Omes Hail are giants related to the very mountains themselves. If these spirits are made visible, they turn into the mighty massifs that shield us against our enemies. Enraged by their plight, the spirits scream and send boulders tumbling down hillsides and into the villages below.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.aragonese.b:1 ""...the peaceful and benevolent Basajaun is a huge man with a beard reaching down to his feet. Twice the size of a normal person, he patrols the woodlands with a tree trunk as a walking stick, warning shepherds of approaching storms or even packs of wolves with a throaty whistle."
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.spain.a:1 ""...the Cuélebre is an unfathomably huge serpent. Though it is practically immortal, the serpent is lazy, and rarely moves from its refuge deep in a cave. Its treasures are said to be almost beyond comprehension, and its spit can heal diseases.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.spain.b:1 ""...Mouros are ancient beings of great power who have lived here since the beginning of the world. Great metalsmiths, the Mouros are rarely seen above-ground. Their maidens are enchanted shapeshifters of great beauty who guard the passages underground.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.spain.c:1 ""...the Anjana are good and kind fairies who take care of forests. With black pupils and gossamer wings, they aid wounded animals and lost people. They tread so lightly that twigs don’t snap under their weight. If you find one of their colorful rose petals you may be happy until your death.""
 fp2_yearly.4008.desc.ending:1 "\n\nThe fire sputters and fades as the old woman finishes her story and chivvies the children to prepare for bed."
 fp2_yearly.4008.a:1 "What a fun old tale!"
 fp2_yearly.4008.b:1 "Ha! Nonsense ghost stories!"
 fp2_yearly.4008.c:1 "You tell a fine tale, old lady!"

 fp2_yearly.4010.t:1 "Celestials of Stone"
 fp2_yearly.4010.desc:1 "It was meant to be a simple trip to visit the [verraco_county.GetName], but I have come across something rare and unusual.\n\nHuge stone figures in the shape of the three main constellations — the Warrior, the Mage and the Thief — stand before me in the wide open country. By the weathering, I would guess they are truly ancient. If they really are that old, then what possibly possessed these people to expend the effort to create monolithic humanoid recreations of... stars?"
 fp2_yearly.4010.a:1 "Perhaps these were tombs... for saints?"
 fp2_yearly.4010.a.success:1 "The people buy in to your theory"
 fp2_yearly.4010.a.fail:1 "The people point out this has no basis in reality"
 fp2_yearly.4010.b:1 "These serve no purpose. Dismantle them."
 fp2_yearly.4010.c:1 "These are blasphemous statues! Tear them down!"
 fp2_yearly.4010.d:1 "Wasting a second thought to them would be a mistake."
