 fp2_yearly.8001.desc:1 "My [commoner_enthusiast.GetCouncilTitle] [commoner_enthusiast.GetTitledFirstName] has long pondered our finances, and now suggests it is time to assemble the #italic Nogoro Dui Yokuda#! — the "Body on the subject of Yokuda", an ancient form of conclave where elected representatives of the free municipalities take part in the deliberations of the royal council. It was last called upon in the times of vassalage under the Reman Empire.\n\n"In return for this privilege", [commoner_enthusiast.GetSheHe] says, "we could tax the cities even more. If we truly need gold, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], we could even allow some of the less wretched peasants to attend our meetings, though I would advice against that, since it would surely infuriate the nobles.""

 fp2_yearly.8005.desc_post_troubadours:1 "I thought only the troubadours of High Rock possessed such talent and wit, but perhaps I was mistaken...\n\nWhat am I to do with these damned #italic feelings#!?"
